Purchase a pre-made composting container from any number of agricultural suppliers. @Build your own box using wood. @Make sure to place the box on bare soil with no watercourses.@ Create a bottom layer. Fork over the soil at the bottom of the container or box to aerate it and assist in drainage. Pile twigs and other straw-like material at the bottom about 8 inches (15.8 cm) deep.@ Fill your bin with the compost that you have chosen @ Check the compost pile after 3 days. Place your hand near the top to determine if it is hot. If it is hot, this is a sign that decomposition has begun. Wait another week, and check the pile again. If it is cool, you can begin to mix it. If it is still hot, wait another week.@ Use a shovel or garden fork to thoroughly mix the contents of the compost bin. Try to move contents from the bottom to the top and vice versa. This aids in the decomposition rate by adding the last ingredient needed to compost: oxygen.@ Add water constantly to the mixture. @Continue to mix the matter throughout the next 4 to 6 weeks. Stop once the heap no longer heats up. The compost must be undisturbed in its final stages in order to complete the process.@ Check the bottom of the bin for compost ready for the garden. Determine if the compost is ready by studying it for a dark brown colour that smells like earth.
