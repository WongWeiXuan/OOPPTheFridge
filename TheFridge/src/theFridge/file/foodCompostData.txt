Rabbit-Manure;src/theFridge/sound/Rabbit Manure.mp4;[Get a good container. Garden stores often sell pre-made compost bins, which are nice because there is no pre-assembly needed.

Coffee-Grounds;src/theFridge/sound/Coffee Grounds.mp4;[Add coffee grounds to your compost. One of the simplest ways to use leftover grounds is to add them to the rest of your compost. In addition to providing extra organic matter, coffee grounds are able to speed up the decomposing process in compost.@ Add grounds to the soil directly to increase acidity. On their own, coffee grounds have a pH of about 5.1 — fairly acidic compared to the soil in most gardens. Though this can be too acidic for some plants, it's perfect for some that require extra-high acidity. Just sprinkle a handful of grounds near the roots of the plants at the start of the growing season to get the acidifying effect.@ Consider adding lime to balance coffee's pH. As noted above, coffee grounds' natural acidity can make them inappropriate for many "average" gardens. To mitigate this, mix a pinch of lime with the grounds.@ Use coffee grounds to add nutrients to your soil. Acidity isn't the only thing that coffee ground have to offer. They are rich in several nutrients that are critical to healthy plants, so if your garden lacks these, coffee grounds are an excellent choice.@ Use grounds to deter pests. Slugs and snails can chew up your most prized plants, but they are not fond of coffee grounds. Sprinkle a handful of grounds around the bases of plants you want to protect. If you're worried about increasing the acidity of the soil, make a solid ring of grounds farther away from the base.@ Use grounds to keep cats out of your garden. Coffee grounds aren't just good for tiny pests. They can also be used to keep feline friends from playing in your delicate plants. In this case, use the grounds just as you'd use them to repel snails — sprinkle them around the plants you want to protect.@ Use coffee grounds as worm food. If you participate in vermiculture (raising worms), you have a great opportunity to use up your coffee grounds. Worms love to eat coffee grounds, so feel free to add plenty to your worm bin or a worm-containing compost pile.@ Use grounds to discourage fungal infection. There is some evidence that coffee grounds can be used to prevent certain types of fungus from attacking your plants. A light sprinkling of coffee grounds may be able to prevent Fusarium, Pythium, and Sclerotinia species of fungi from taking root.]

Depending on the construction of the bin, it can also help to regulate moisture and temperature.@ Heat the cheese until it melted.@ Layer or mix the cheese in your bin so that they come into contact with one another and so that you avoid any large clumps. Especially avoid compacting large quantities of green materials together, since they can rapidly become anaerobic.@ Turn your pile regularly, once every week or two. Clear a patch next to the pile. Then use a pitchfork and move the entire pile to the clear spot. @When it is time to turn the pile again, move it back to the original spot, or back into the bin. @Mixing the pile in this way helps to keep air flowing inside the pile, which encourages aerobic decomposition.]
