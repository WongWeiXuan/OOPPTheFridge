Seaweed;src/theFridge/sound/Seaweed.mp4;[First you have to dry all the seaweed under the sun for about 3 hours. @ Take all the dried seaweed and place it over the soil. @ Ensure the seaweed is thickly placed over the soil. @ Reapply the seaweed at the same spot of the soil after 6 weeks to ensure the plants can fully absorb the minerals. @ After 10 weeks, remove the dried seaweed from the soil to prevent pest such as termites and worms from destroying the plants]
Rabbit-Manure;src/theFridge/sound/Rabbit Manure.mp4;[Get a good container. Garden stores often sell pre-made compost bins, which are nice because there is no pre-assembly needed.  However, you can make a free one with pallets, or use other materials.@ Collect your rabbit's poop.  Simply use a tray under his or her hutch or cage, then bring the tray out to the compost bin.@ Every time you add more bunny poo (wet matter) add twice the amount of dry matter (dry leaves).@ Every two weeks, mix the compost pile up.  This helps get air to the bacteria that make the decomposing happen.@ When your bunny poo compost is a dark, earthy-smelling, crumbly dirt, it is ready.  Spread it over your garden or mix it in with the original soil.]
Coffee-Grounds;src/theFridge/sound/Coffee Grounds.mp4;[Add coffee grounds to your compost. One of the simplest ways to use leftover grounds is to add them to the rest of your compost. In addition to providing extra organic matter, coffee grounds are able to speed up the decomposing process in compost.@ Add grounds to the soil directly to increase acidity. On their own, coffee grounds have a pH of about 5.1 — fairly acidic compared to the soil in most gardens. Though this can be too acidic for some plants, it's perfect for some that require extra-high acidity. Just sprinkle a handful of grounds near the roots of the plants at the start of the growing season to get the acidifying effect.@ Consider adding lime to balance coffee's pH. As noted above, coffee grounds' natural acidity can make them inappropriate for many "average" gardens. To mitigate this, mix a pinch of lime with the grounds.@ Use coffee grounds to add nutrients to your soil. Acidity isn't the only thing that coffee ground have to offer. They are rich in several nutrients that are critical to healthy plants, so if your garden lacks these, coffee grounds are an excellent choice.@ Use grounds to deter pests. Slugs and snails can chew up your most prized plants, but they are not fond of coffee grounds. Sprinkle a handful of grounds around the bases of plants you want to protect. If you're worried about increasing the acidity of the soil, make a solid ring of grounds farther away from the base.@ Use grounds to keep cats out of your garden. Coffee grounds aren't just good for tiny pests. They can also be used to keep feline friends from playing in your delicate plants. In this case, use the grounds just as you'd use them to repel snails — sprinkle them around the plants you want to protect.@ Use coffee grounds as worm food. If you participate in vermiculture (raising worms), you have a great opportunity to use up your coffee grounds. Worms love to eat coffee grounds, so feel free to add plenty to your worm bin or a worm-containing compost pile.@ Use grounds to discourage fungal infection. There is some evidence that coffee grounds can be used to prevent certain types of fungus from attacking your plants. A light sprinkling of coffee grounds may be able to prevent Fusarium, Pythium, and Sclerotinia species of fungi from taking root.]
Mouldy-Cheese;src/theFridge/sound/Cheese.mp4;[Construct a bin for your compost. While you still can compost successfully in a pile on the ground, a bin will keep the process neater and will help to discourage animals if you are composting food scraps. Depending on the construction of the bin, it can also help to regulate moisture and temperature.@ Heat the cheese until it melted.@ Layer or mix the cheese in your bin so that they come into contact with one another and so that you avoid any large clumps. Especially avoid compacting large quantities of green materials together, since they can rapidly become anaerobic.@ Turn your pile regularly, once every week or two. Clear a patch next to the pile. Then use a pitchfork and move the entire pile to the clear spot. @When it is time to turn the pile again, move it back to the original spot, or back into the bin. @Mixing the pile in this way helps to keep air flowing inside the pile, which encourages aerobic decomposition.]
Crab-or-Lobster-Shell;src/theFridge/sound/Fish and Crab.mp4;[Figure out where to put your compost but its recommended to be stored outside your house as it may cause bad smell from the compost. @Try to ensure some crab or lobster shells are placed in the compost bin weekly.@ After about a month, check if your compost have decomposed. If it is still in a hard solid state, wait a while more for the shells to fully decompose.@ Ensure some water is sprinkled onto the shell compost so the fertilizer would fully develop@ Spread this thick layer of fertilizer onto the garden soil so that plants can absorb all the minerals.@ If these fertilizers are not used, store places where it has cool temperature to prevent fertilizers from losing their contents.]
Fish-bones;src/theFridge/sound/Fish and Crab.mp4;[Determine if there is a commercial composting operation available in your area. Commercial composting (or "industrial composting") is a large-scale composting operation that usually serves an entire city or an even larger region. This type of setup generally helps to divert more food waste from landfills, as residents are more likely to drop off their scraps for pickup rather than maintain a compost pile of their own.@ Compost the fish remains using an underground compost setup. @Underground composting allows for the composting of fish because the buried remains will not produce an odour or attract pests.@ Add the fish remains to an enclosed composter. @If the above options are unavailable to you, you can add the fish to your regular composting setup if you proceed carefully.@ Fish scraps should not be added to open above-ground compost piles, even ones with enclosures made from poultry wire or wood slats.]
Citrus-Peel;src/theFridge/sound/Citrus peel.mp4;[Know your peel. There are many types of citrus, including orange, mandarin, kumquat, grapefruit, lemon, lime, pomelo, citron (citrus apple), tangerines, etc.@ Always wash the peel extremely well before use. If possible, prefer organic sources rather than those which have been sprayed, especially for any food or internal use.@ See "Warnings" below for the possibility of dermatitis and allergic reactions to citrus peel.@ Use the peel of a kumquat to make marmalade. Just cook the chopped peel with sugar-water until it's like a syrup — use your favourite marmalade recipe.@ Peel a lemon and use it to bathe yourself in the shower. It leaves your body and hair smelling fresh and clean.@ Infuse lemon peel in your tea to add a delicious lemony taste.@ Citrus peels such as peel of lemon work well for roasting chicken. Put peel into the chicken and roast. You will find a great smelling and good tasting chicken. @Use mandarin peels for tea. Make sure you wash the mandarin before experimenting.]
Apple;src/theFridge/sound/Apple.mp4;[Check and ensure that the apple have not been affected by any diseases as this might lead to the compost being harmful instead of helpful@ Do a simple test by checking the seed of the apple. Greenish seeds tend to be the harmful ones. @ Peel off the apple skins as they do not contributes to the compost@ Cut the remaining apple into as small and thin as possible to ensure they break down to fertilizer faster. @ Places these apple slices into your compost bin and wait patiently for the apple to fully decompose into dark minerals.@ Ensure that the compost are not placed in chunks and are spread out evenly for all the minerals to dissolve into the soil.]
Old-Pasta;src/theFridge/sound/Pasta.mp4;[Select your compost bin. There are many types of bins used to hold the composting materials. There are commercially made square or cone shaped plastic bins, homemade square bins often made of wood, and many more.@ For pasta, square shaped compost bin is recommended. @ For pasta compost, it should not be stored under extreme temperatures. The suitable temperature is around 30 degrees. @ Other than adding your old and waste pasta into the bin, ensure you also regularly add other composting materials such as leaves, egg shells, cardboard, water in small amount and even saw dust. @ For every amount of pile, add a layer of twigs or branches to further enhance the richness of the nutrients. @ Lastly add the compost to any ground soil or potted plants.]
